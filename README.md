Cyber Projects

Hello there! Here you can check out my cyber security projects and exercises me and my team have done during my studies at JAMK University of Applied Sciences. All projects were conducted in a virtual environment, where we simulated a real company setting. This allowed us to apply cybersecurity concepts in realistic scenarios, improving our technical skills and teamwork. You can also find our own assesments/analysis about big cyber security attacks that have happened.
